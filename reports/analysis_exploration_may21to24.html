    <h1>Data Cleaning for E-commerce Sales: Preprocessing Modularization</h1>

<p>Before entering university, I gained work experience handling Excel data in real-world environments. Often, there was no predecessor to guide me, and no time allocated for thorough training, so I learned to explore data contents myself, carefully examining each column’s meaning and characteristics to build a solid foundation for analysis.</p> 
<p>Between 2017 and 2021, I attended university <strong>with the purpose of recurrent education</strong>, where I studied survey methodology, data interpretation, and practical statistics using Excel. For this analysis project, I also borrowed books on Python and PostgreSQL. However, I realized that data preprocessing and missing value handling depend heavily on context, and there is no single “correct” approach.</p>
<p>Therefore, I focus on asking myself questions like “Where should I start?” and “What should I prioritize?” and use my experience and intuition to gradually engage with the data. Despite being new to data analysis as a profession, I believe this mindset allows me to approach projects with a practical and thoughtful perspective similar to real-world business settings.</p>

<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>

<p>Before diving into the analysis, thorough data preprocessing was conducted to ensure data quality and reliability. The key steps included:</p>

<li><strong>Data Type Verification</strong></li>
<P>Each column’s data type was carefully checked and corrected where necessary to prevent errors during analysis.</P>

<li><strong>Missing Value Inspection</strong></li>
<P>Missing data patterns were visualized and assessed. Rather than immediately imputing or deleting missing values, missingness was explicitly flagged as a feature to maintain analytical integrity.</P>

<li><strong>Duplicate Record Detection</strong></li>
<P><strong>No duplicate records were found in the dataset</strong>, indicating good data quality and reducing the risk of skewed analysis due to redundant entries.</P>

<li><strong>Outlier Detection</strong></li>
<P>Both IQR (Interquartile Range) and Z-score methods were applied to numeric columns such as quantity and amount to detect anomalies.</P>
<p>Outlier counts varied depending on the method, with IQR identifying more extreme values and Z-score highlighting subtler deviations.</p>

<li><strong>Categorical Rare Value Identification</strong></li>
<P>Categories with a frequency below 1% were extracted for further review, as rare values can impact model performance or indicate data entry errors.</P>

<li><strong>Validation of Key Identifiers</strong></li>
<P>Regular expressions were used to validate critical fields like Order ID and postal codes, flagging entries that did not conform to expected formats.</P>

<P>This preprocessing pipeline laid a solid foundation for subsequent analysis by improving data consistency and highlighting areas requiring special attention. The cleaned and validated dataset is saved and ready for modeling and visualization.</P>

<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<p>Currently refining and improving the core function clean_data() in cleaning_pipeline.py.</p>
<p>Once completed, it will be added to the portfolio.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Progress Update</h3>
<p>Since my personal break following the previous report, I have been progressing steadily and efficiently, managing my time carefully to balance this project alongside other commitments, and will continue to do so.</p>
